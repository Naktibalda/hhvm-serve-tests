# hhvm-serve tests

The objective of this project is to demonstrate incompatibilities between [PHP Built-in web server](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) and [hhvm-serve](https://github.com/Naktibalda/hhvm-serve) and fix them.

The tests are executed in php and hhvm environments on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
